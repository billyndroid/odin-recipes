   <h2>Description</h2>
    <P>For best results, choose tender Welsh lamb. This will be marinated in a Greek lemon vinaigrette, threaded on skewers and char-grilled to perfection. </P>
    <p>I like to serve these with Welsh rarebit and a pint of Brains SA (if you know, you know).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil </li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice  </li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons red wine vinegar </li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh oregano </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of all fat and cut into 1-inch cubes </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <lh>Steps</lh>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add cubed lamb and stir until all of the lamb is coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Thread marinated lamb onto skewers, reserving any remaining marinade. Grill skewers until desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade and turning occasionally for even cooking.</li>
